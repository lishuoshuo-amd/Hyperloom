# CLI reference

KernelForge installs exactly one CLI, `kernelforge`; everything below is a
subcommand of it.

Every option each subcommand accepts is listed here. That is a contract, not a
courtesy: an option no subcommand declares is a usage error, and the run exits 2
during argument parsing before any GPU work starts. Nothing is dropped, ignored,
or absorbed into a default, so a misspelled flag costs a message and an exit
code rather than an hour of tuning against a value you did not ask for.

One option lives on `kernelforge` itself rather than on any subcommand:

| Option | Meaning |
|:--|:--|
| `--version` | Print the installed KernelForge version and exit. |

## Core

See {doc}`Experience store </kernelforge/reference/experience-store>` for the exact
local/remote environment contract and durable local layout.

## kernel-rewrite-controller

Initializes one fresh autonomous kernel-rewrite controller run. It validates the
Hyperloom handoff, runs one long-lived opportunity-analysis Agent, atomically
publishes complete operator tasks, and dispatches them sequentially through
named-kernel `forge-loop` campaigns. The Agent may inspect existing trace and
source evidence but cannot run shell commands, profiling, or serving benchmarks.

| Option | Default | Meaning |
|:--|:--|:--|
| `--handoff-dir <dir>` | required | Directory containing `workload.md`, `serving-context.md`, and `trace-evidence.md`. |
| `--budget-minutes <m>` | required | Positive total wall-clock budget used to derive the controller deadline. |
| `--output-dir <dir>` | required | Fresh macro-cycle output directory. Existing controller output is refused rather than resumed. |

## forge-loop

Runs one measurement-driven optimization campaign over a single kernel:
baseline → agent → validate → bench → keep. The campaign is resumable — its
immutable inputs are snapshotted into
`<workspace>/forge_experiments/campaign_config.json` and the control state into
`run_state.json`. The result dict (`baseline_ms`, `best_ms`,
`mean_case_speedup`, `improved`, `experiment_id`, `iteration_count`) is printed
to stdout wrapped in `__FORGE_RESULT__` sentinels.

Stop a running campaign with `touch <workspace>/.stop`; the loop checks for that
file at the next iteration boundary.

### Campaign inputs

Everything in this group except `--workspace` and `--resume` belongs to a fresh
campaign. Once the campaign config is snapshotted these values are immutable,
and passing one alongside `--resume` is refused rather than silently ignored.

| Option | Default | Meaning |
|:--|:--|:--|
| `--workspace <dir>` | required | Git workspace the campaign runs in. |
| `--resume` | off | Continue the campaign already stored in that exact workspace. |
| `--kernel <file>` | none | The kernel file to optimize. This is the anchor the loop edits. |
| `--driver <file>` | none | The validation/bench driver. |
| `--auto` | off | Pick the kernel here instead of being handed one. Requires `--nomination-input`, refuses `--kernel` and `--resume`, and makes the result carry a `patches` array plus nomination counts. Off by default, so a run without it is unchanged. |
| `--nomination-input <file>` | `''` | Nomination request JSON: raw trace path, candidate list path, lane budget and target ceiling. Read only under `--auto`. |
| `--git-branch <name>` | none | Development branch to optimize on, checked out before the campaign config is snapshotted. |
| `--program-md-file <file>` | none | Optional task context copied into the campaign. |
| `--invocation-spec-file <file>` | none | Hyperloom invocation-spec JSON used by task preparation. |
| `--task-type <name>` | `''` | `repository` or `image_kernel` enable multi-file / whole-repo handling; any other value keeps single-file behavior. |
| `--source-files <a,b>` | `''` | Comma/newline-separated implementation entry points used for orientation, profiling, JIT hints and KB identity. Not an edit allowlist — `--kernel` remains the anchor. |
| `--target-functions <a,b>` | `''` | Comma-separated target kernel/function hints, used for PMC filtering, source mapping and agent orientation. Does not restrict which functions may be edited. |
| `--operator-name <name>` | `''` | Logical operator identity used by profiling and the experience page key. |
| `--framework <name>` | inferred | Framework identity for the experience KB slug: `vllm`, `sglang`, `aiter`, or `standalone` for a framework-less file. Authoritative when given. |
| `--kernel-backend <name>` | inferred | Kernel backend override. An unsupported backend falls back to `flydsl`. |
| `--commit-new-path <glob>` | none | Workspace-relative path or glob naming a file the agent may CREATE and still have committed with a KEEP. Repeatable. Untracked files are otherwise never staged and never removed by a REVERT. `*` does not cross a directory separator and `**` is rejected; name each level. Protected measurement paths are never admitted. Immutable per campaign. |
| `--snr-threshold <dB>` | `30.0` | Threshold the driver's correctness suite must clear, stored immutably. A KEEP needs this and a measured gain over the incumbent; the assembly backend adds the task's own acceptance suite on top. |
| `--prepare-task` / `--no-prepare-task` | on | Pre-loop preflight of the driver against the loop's stdout contract; on failure one agent authors or repairs the measurement driver (never the kernel), then it is re-checked. Skipped on `--resume`. |
| `--baseline-json <file>` | none | JSON file holding a scoring anchor measured outside this loop: `{"wall_ms": <float>, "case_times": {"<case id>": <ms>}}`. Every speedup the run reports then divides by those per-case times, and they are the wall time published beside it. The loop still benches the kernel it starts from, but as the search start and first incumbent rather than as the anchor — so the KEEP bar begins at that kernel's own score, not at 1.0x. Use it when the starting kernel already replaced something else and the run should be graded against the original: `forge-rewrite` passes its source kernel's timings this way. Omitted, the loop anchors on its own first bench. |

### Budget and deadlines

| Option | Default | Meaning |
|:--|:--|:--|
| `--max-hours <h>` | `1.0` | Runtime budget in hours; the loop is time-driven. Minimum `1.0`. A round is started only when what remains can finish it, so the run ends before the budget does. Above 2 hours this also enables Analysis profiling and, for single-lane rounds, Plan Critic review. |
| `--deadline-unix <t>` | `0` | Absolute UNIX deadline shared by task preparation and optimization. |
| `--session-timeout-sec <s>` | from `--max-hours` | Wall-clock budget for one implementer session. The claude backend cuts the session at this deadline and the session is told about it. |
| `--agent-timeout-sec <s>` | provider default | Timeout for one Agent session. |
| `--profile-timeout-sec <s>` | `7200` | Ceiling for the single complete Analysis Agent session. Phase and case artifacts are persisted for resume when the deadline is reached. |

### Hardware and measurement

| Option | Default | Meaning |
|:--|:--|:--|
| `--gpu-target <arch>` | none | ROCm compilation architecture, e.g. `gfx950`. Also exported to the environment. |
| `--gpu-type <sku>` | `mi355x` | Hardware SKU used in knowledge-base identities. |
| `--nproc-per-node <n>` | `1` | Ranks the driver self-launches via torchrun, for collective tasks such as all-reduce. Above 1, EVERY rank is profiled in its own rocprofv3 session — wrapping the driver would only profile the launcher process, which runs no kernel. |
| `--bench-repeat <n>` | `1` | How many times each bench repeats its measurement in-process, reporting the per-case median. Above 1 shrinks run-to-run spread and requires a driver that accepts `--repeat`; the flag is omitted entirely when this is 1. |
| `--aiter-cache-max-gb <g>` | `4.0` | Per-attempt AITER cache soft limit in GiB. LRU pruning targets 75% of the limit; `0` disables in-run pruning. |
| `--profiling` / `--no-profiling` | on | Allow Analysis hardware profiling and Implementer self-profiling guidance on long-horizon runs (>2 hours). Shorter runs keep Analysis static-only regardless. `--no-profiling` disables collection for every duration. |
| `--roofline-ceiling <on\|off>` | `off` | Whether the campaign has a per-shape theoretical achievable latency to measure its attainment against. `off` skips it entirely, including any report already sitting in the workspace. `on` estimates one on a fresh campaign once the baseline has fixed the scored case set and its per-case times, which costs a profiler pass and an analyst session, typically tens of minutes; on `--resume` it reuses the ceiling this campaign already estimated, so the target stays fixed for the campaign, and estimates again only when that report can no longer be read or no longer covers every scored case. Session-scoped: pass it on every `--resume` that should keep the ceiling. |
| `--roofline-target <fraction>` | `0.0` (off) | Stop the campaign once mean per-case attainment reaches this fraction of the estimated ceiling, e.g. `0.86`. Attainment is `ceiling / measured` per case, averaged with equal weight across scored cases — the same aggregate a KEEP is scored by. The gate fires only when every scored case has a figure: a case whose ceiling sits below its measured latency, or that the ceiling never answered, is excluded from the mean, and a mean over a subset is not the objective it claims to report. Requires a ceiling, and refuses a value above `1.0`. A ceiling is an estimate whose arithmetic nothing checks, so this is off by default — and it never enters the KEEP decision, which stays a measurement against the incumbent. |

### Rounds and lanes

| Option | Default | Meaning |
|:--|:--|:--|
| `--lanes <n>` | `3` | Implementer lanes per round (1–8). Above 1 the round's analysis is partitioned into that many non-overlapping plans, each run concurrently in its own workspace copy and measured on its own. Lanes run concurrently, so a lane costs a session rather than a share of the round's wall clock, and three is what the three specialist analyses divide into. The partition returns fewer when the evidence supports fewer. Needs a provider declaring `session_env`; refused on one that does not, because lanes sharing a build cache measure each other's binaries. A provider without `stop_hooks` runs and is warned: it loses in-session denial, so a lane can waste its session or void the round, but it cannot misreport one. |
| `--merge-stacking` / `--no-merge-stacking` | on | Once consecutive iterations stop producing a new best, spend one iteration measuring two archived rejected gains applied together, chosen for winning on different cases. Costs a measurement but no Implementer session. Applies at every `--lanes` setting; turn it off to compare against a run that predates it. |
| `--specialist-probe` / `--no-specialist-probe` | on | Let the read-only planning specialists measure one variant per probe in a scratch tree instead of only arguing about a dispatch constant. Each probe re-runs the workspace driver for one case with declared constants overridden, queues on the same device lock the fan-out lanes take, and never touches the canonical tree. Falls back to `FORGE_SPECIALIST_PROBE`. |
| `--specialist-probe-max <n>` | `6` | Probes ONE analysis round may make in total, shared across every specialist it dispatches. Every call counts, including a refused one. Falls back to `FORGE_SPECIALIST_PROBE_MAX`. |
| `--specialist-probe-budget-sec <s>` | `600` | Seconds on the device ONE analysis round may spend probing, shared across its specialists, and cut down further at call time so no probe leaves a specialist without time to write its analysis. Falls back to `FORGE_SPECIALIST_PROBE_BUDGET_SEC`. |
| `--specialist-probe-scratch-root <dir>` | under `--experiments-dir` | Where round scratch trees are created. Must be absolute and outside the workspace; defaults to a sibling of the workspace when the default would land inside it. Falls back to `FORGE_SPECIALIST_PROBE_SCRATCH_ROOT`. |

### Agent provider

| Option | Default | Meaning |
|:--|:--|:--|
| `--agent-backend <name>` | provider default | Registered local Agent provider for the Implementer. |
| `--supervisor-backend <name>` | follows Implementer | Registered provider for the stalled-search (AVO) supervisor. Omit it so one `--agent-backend` controls every local agent. |
| `--agent-cli <path>` | provider default | Provider executable path or command. |
| `--model <name>` | provider default | Selected provider model. |
| `--agent-reasoning-effort <v>` | provider default | Provider reasoning effort value. |
| `--agent-sandbox-mode <v>` | provider default | Provider sandbox mode. |
| `--agent-fallback-provider <name>` | provider default | Fallback provider name, or `none` to refuse a fallback. |
| `--agent-precheck` / `--no-agent-precheck` | on | Provider preflight and capability probe. |
| `--agent-options-json <json>` | none | Provider extension options as a JSON object. |
| `--permission-mode <v>` | provider default | Provider permission mode, where the provider supports one. |

### Knowledge base

| Option | Default | Meaning |
|:--|:--|:--|
| `--experience-kb` / `--no-experience-kb` | on | Read and publish forge-loop experience KB entries. Internal callers with their own KB lifecycle, such as `forge-rewrite-by-flydsl`, disable this explicitly. |
| `--kb-warmstart` / `--no-kb-warmstart` | on | Apply the best matching KB solution before iteration 1. Only meaningful with `--experience-kb`. A caller that prepares the workspace itself, such as `forge-fuse`, turns this off to keep publishing while never replaying a stored patch over a tree it already staged. |
| `--return-after-read-kb` / `--return-after-read-KB` | off | Return before iteration 1 when a KB solution applies cleanly, passes current correctness and improves current performance. |
| `--producer <name>` | forge-loop's own | System owning the candidate stream these records belong to. A producer has its own index in the KB identity scheme, so a pipeline driving this command as a subprocess keeps its records out of the kernel campaigns' ranking. |
| `--pr-kb` / `--no-pr-kb` | off | Inject upstream pull-request references from the PR Monitor co-hosted at `${KB_STORE_URL}/pr-monitor/v1`. Falls back to `PR_KB_ENABLE`. |
| `--experience-id <id>` | `''` | Unique KB run identity, independent of the checkpoint experiment ID. |

### Output

| Option | Default | Meaning |
|:--|:--|:--|
| `--experiments-dir <dir>` | `<W>/forge_experiments` | Diagnostics and checkpoint root: profiles, optimization potential, tracker checkpoint. Resume artifacts always live under the workspace regardless. |
| `--experiment-id <id>` | none | Caller-owned experiment ID, recorded for external checkpoint recovery. |
| `--result-json <file>` | none | Write the result dict here as well as printing it. |

## forge-rewrite-by-flydsl

Ports a source kernel (Triton, HIP, CUDA or C++) into an equivalent FlyDSL
kernel in a correctness-only PORT phase, then hands the FlyDSL kernel to
`forge-loop` for optimization. With an existing framework git base, the final
20 minutes are reserved for one session that turns the verified best FlyDSL
kernel into a cumulative framework apply-back patch. The driver uses the original
kernel as a live correctness oracle and baseline, so this works for any
operator. The result (`source_ms`, `flydsl_best_ms`, `speedup`, `correct`) uses
the same `__FORGE_RESULT__` contract as `forge-loop`.

### Source and workspace

| Option | Default | Meaning |
|:--|:--|:--|
| `--source-kernel <file>` | required | The kernel to rewrite (a Triton `.py`, a `.hip`, …). |
| `--driver <file>` | required | Rewrite measurement driver. A conforming driver is used unchanged. |
| `--logical-op-name <name>` | required | Stable logical identity of the workload; a namespace or punctuation is allowed. The FlyDSL factory symbol is derived from it and reported in the result — never re-derive it downstream. `--op-name` is a deprecated alias. |
| `--workspace <dir>` | required | Git workspace directory. |
| `--experiments-dir <dir>` | required | Where to write `forge_experiments`. |
| `--source-entry <fn>` | auto | Host callable in the source that runs the kernel, used as the live oracle and baseline: `ref(x) -> y`. |
| `--source-language <lang>` | inferred | One of the source languages reported by `--capabilities-json`. Inferred from the file when omitted, but a caller whose profiler saw the kernel run should state it: a traced Triton kernel lives in a `.py` that names no language. |
| `--target-functions <a,b>` | `''` | Source kernel entry names: the `@triton.jit` name, or the `__global__` function name for HIP/CUDA. |
| `--shapes-json <json>` | `[]` | JSON list of `{M,N,dtype}` shapes driving correctness and benchmarking. |
| `--flydsl-kernel-name <file>` | `kernel.py` | Filename of the produced FlyDSL kernel in the workspace. |
| `--git-branch <name>` | `forge-rewrite-optimize` | Development branch used by the nested FlyDSL forge-loop. |
| `--invocation-spec-file <file>` | `''` | Invocation evidence JSON, used only by rewrite driver preparation. |
| `--prepare-driver` / `--no-prepare-driver` | on | Author or repair a non-conforming dual-path rewrite driver before PORT. |

### Budget and phases

| Option | Default | Meaning |
|:--|:--|:--|
| `--max-hours <h>` | `1.0` | Total rewrite budget across PORT, OPTIMIZE and apply-back. Minimum `1.0`. |
| `--deadline-unix <t>` | `0` | Absolute UNIX deadline for PORT, OPTIMIZE and apply-back finalization. |
| `--max-port-attempts <n>` | `3` | Correctness-only port sessions before giving up. |
| `--profile-timeout-sec <s>` | `3600` | OPTIMIZE: ceiling for the complete Analysis Agent workflow. |
| `--roofline-ceiling <on\|off>` | `off` | OPTIMIZE: passed unchanged to the nested `forge-loop`, where it means what `forge-loop --roofline-ceiling` means. `on` estimates the kernel's per-shape theoretical achievable latency once the loop's baseline is measured and steers its planner by the attainment against it; the estimate's profiler pass and analyst session are paid out of the OPTIMIZE budget. |
| `--snr-threshold <dB>` | `30.0` | Correctness gate for the ported kernel. |

### Apply-back

| Option | Default | Meaning |
|:--|:--|:--|
| `--framework <name>` | inferred | Apply-back target: `aiter`, `vllm` or `sglang`. Inferred from the source path when omitted. |
| `--applyback-import-module <mod>` | inferred | Import target required to load before and after apply-back. Repeatable; defaults to the source module inferred from its package. |
| `--applyback` / `--no-applyback` | on | Integrate the optimized kernel back into the framework repository and publish the patch. Disabling it delivers only the standalone kernel: the stage is skipped, its 20-minute reserve returns to the search, and `success` no longer depends on a patch the caller did not ask for. `applyback_required` is then `false`, and `best_commit` names the standalone selection instead of an apply-back commit. |
| `--max-applyback-attempts <n>` | `2` | Maximum clean-room framework integration sessions. |

### Hardware, provider and output

| Option | Default | Meaning |
|:--|:--|:--|
| `--gpu-target <arch>` | none | ROCm compilation architecture, e.g. `gfx950`. Also exported to the environment. |
| `--gpu-type <sku>` | `mi355x` | Hardware SKU for rewrite KB identities. |
| `--model <name>` | provider default | LLM model; overrides `CLAUDE_MODEL`/`CODEX_MODEL`. |
| `--permission-mode <v>` | `acceptEdits` | Claude permission mode. |
| `--supervisor-backend <name>` | `codex` | OPTIMIZE supervisor backend on stall: `codex` or `claude`. |
| `--rewrite-kb` / `--no-rewrite-kb` | on | Read and publish rewrite recipes. |
| `--result-json <file>` | none | Write the result dict here as well as printing it. |

### Handshakes

Both print to stdout and exit without running anything.

| Option | Meaning |
|:--|:--|
| `--capabilities-json` | The machine-readable rewrite capability handshake: protocol version, artifact schema, sentinel, frameworks, source languages and source kinds. Probe this before invoking, rather than inferring support from a run that failed. |
| `--applyback-contract-json` | Producer-authored apply-back manifest and outer-result examples. |

## forge-fuse

Diagnoses a decode trace, locates a launch-bound chain of small kernels, and
authors one fused Triton kernel that survives CUDA-graph capture, A/B-validated
against the framework's own eager op. Writes `fusion_manifest.json` and exits 3
when no fusion is found.

Which chain is fused is chosen from the trace by default. `--fuse-kernel` fixes it
instead: name one GPU kernel and the fusion is built around that kernel and its
trace neighbours. With `--dry-run` this resolves and writes `fusion_anchor.json`
without reaching an agent, so the selection can be checked before anything is spent.

### Inputs

| Option | Default | Meaning |
|:--|:--|:--|
| `--trace <file>` | `''` | Decode kineto trace (`*.trace.json[.gz]`), captured with CUDA graphs disabled. |
| `--model-path <dir>` | `''` | Model directory; must contain `config.json`. |
| `--framework <name>` | none | `sglang`, `vllm` or `vllm-aiter`. |
| `--output-dir <dir>` | `''` | Manifest and logs. |
| `--framework-root <dir>` | auto-detect | Explicit framework source root, else the installed package is located. |
| `--decode-batch <n>` | `16` | Representative decode batch size (T) for shapes. |
| `--decode-steps <n>` | `0` | Decode steps captured in the trace, used to normalize kernels/step. |

### Discovery and authoring

| Option | Default | Meaning |
|:--|:--|:--|
| `--discover <mode>` | `patterns` | `patterns` (template library), `llm` (the LLM reads trace and source, autonomous), or `anchored` (fuse around the kernel `--fuse-kernel` names). |
| `--repo-scope` / `--no-repo-scope` | off | Give discovery and authoring the whole framework repository instead of one resolved file. Discovery embeds no source, explores the tree with its own read/search tools, and may return a fusion whose call sites span several files; authoring may edit all of them. Use when the chain is not in the arch-class model file and you do not want to name its location. Requires `--discover llm` or `--discover anchored`. |
| `--fuse-kernel <name>` | `''` | Full GPU kernel name, exactly as the trace spells it. Fusion is then built around that kernel and whatever the trace shows running beside it, instead of a ranked guess. Implies `--discover anchored`. A name the trace does not contain is a usage error listing the closest ones; a fragment is not a name. |
| `--dry-run` | off | Diagnose and locate only; emit a manifest with a recipe skeleton, no authoring or validation. |
| `--author` / `--no-author` | on | Author the fused kernel via the LLM. Non-dry-run only. |
| `--fuse-all-confirmed` | off | Author ALL source-confirmed patterns together rather than only the top one, and A/B all their flags. A compile-pass candidate cannot be authored with them, so it is claimed alone and the rest wait for a later round. |
| `--agent-backend <name>` | `auto` | `auto`, `claude` or `codex`, for discovery and authoring. |
| `--agent-sandbox-mode <v>` | `workspace-write` | `workspace-write`, `read-only` or `bypass`. Use `bypass` only when an external sandbox already enforces isolation. |
| `--model <name>` | provider default | Agent model. An explicit value wins; otherwise `$CODEX_MODEL` / `$CLAUDE_MODEL`, then the registered provider default. |
| `--max-turns <n>` | `100` | Max authoring turns. |
| `--max-recipes <n>` | `0` | Cap how many ranked recipes to try. `0` means uncapped, so every discovered recipe is considered; Hyperloom passes the count its fusion lane budget pays for. |
| `--gpu <id>` | `0` | HIP device id for authoring and A/B. |
| `--gpu-target <arch>` | auto-detect | Canonical GPU arch the author writes for, e.g. `gfx950`; detected via `rocminfo` when omitted. |

### A/B validation and serving smoke

| Option | Default | Meaning |
|:--|:--|:--|
| `--validate` / `--no-validate` | on | Run the A/B decode validation. Non-dry-run only. |
| `--ab-isl <n>` | `512` | A/B input length. |
| `--ab-osl <n>` | `128` | A/B output length. |
| `--server-extra <args>` | `''` | Extra serving args for the smoke launch, e.g. `--kv-cache-dtype fp8`. A model whose engine refuses to start without a flag can never reach the kernel the smoke exists to exercise. |
| `--tp <n>` | `1` | Tensor-parallel size for the serving smoke; must match the session. |
| `--block-size <n>` | `0` (omit) | vLLM KV `--block-size` for the serving smoke. Required for sparse-attention models that reject the default block size. |
| `--max-model-len <n>` | `0` (smoke default 4096) | Serving-smoke max model / context length. |

### Diagnostics

| Option | Default | Meaning |
|:--|:--|:--|
| `--harness-noise <name>` | `''` | Repeat one kernel-validation harness and report its variance. |
| `--harness-noise-repeat <n>` | `20` | How many times to repeat that harness. |
| `--harness-noise-env <k=v>` | none | Env flag to set for each harness run. Repeatable. |
| `--verbose` / `-v` | off | Verbose logging. |
| `--version` | — | Print the version and exit. |

## gemm-tune

Tunes vendor GEMM libraries for one model. It reads no knowledge base: every run
tunes from scratch and writes only its own output directory.

```bash
kernelforge gemm-tune run --model-path <M> --framework sglang|vllm|vllm-aiter \
    --precision <p> --output-dir <D>       # Tune, and write the artifacts
kernelforge gemm-tune plan --model-path <M> --framework <F> --precision <p>
                                           # Show which tuners would run, without running them
kernelforge gemm-tune evidence <logs...> --out demand.json
                                           # Derive shape demand from serving logs
```

### gemm-tune run

Model and target:

| Option | Default | Meaning |
|:--|:--|:--|
| `--model-path <dir>` | required | Model directory; must contain `config.json`. |
| `--framework <name>` | required | `sglang`, `vllm` or `vllm-aiter` (vllm with `VLLM_ROCM_USE_AITER=1`). |
| `--precision <p>` | required | `bf16`, `fp8`, `fp4`, `int8` or `awq`. |
| `--quant-type <q>` | `auto` | `auto`, `none`, `per_token`, `blockscale`, `bpreshuffle`, `awq`, `gptq`, `fp4` or `mxfp4`. |
| `--gpu-type <sku>` | `auto` | `auto` detects via `rocminfo`; otherwise `mi300x`, `mi355x`, `gfx942`, … |
| `--output-dir <dir>` | required | Output directory for all artifacts. |

Shape sources, in descending priority — `--demand` wins, then
`--shapes-manifest`, then `--shapes-json`:

| Option | Default | Meaning |
|:--|:--|:--|
| `--demand <file>` | `''` | `demand.json` from `kernelforge gemm-tune evidence`; the highest-priority shape source. |
| `--shapes-manifest <file>` | `''` | Weighted `TraceShapeManifest` JSON; the preferred dense-shape source when set. |
| `--shapes-json <file>` | `''` | Shapes JSON from TraceLens or Hyperloom. |
| `--untuned-csv <file>` | `''` | Input untuned CSV for the dense aiter tuners. |
| `--moe-untuned-csv <file>` | `''` | Input untuned CSV for the MoE tuner, keyed on the tuple aiter dispatched at run time. |
| `--tunableop-input <file>` | `''` | PyTorch TunableOp shape file. |
| `--kernel-signature-log <file>` | `''` | Server log for 1-stage ASM detection. |
| `--tokens <a,b>` | auto | Comma-separated explicit token list, overriding the automatic coverage. |
| `--conc <n>` | `64` | Target serving concurrency, used for token coverage. |
| `--tp <n>` | `1` | Tensor-parallel degree. |

Search and execution:

| Option | Default | Meaning |

### gemm-tune plan

Reports which tuners `run` would dispatch, and on which shapes, without tuning
anything. It takes the model, target and shape-source options of `run` and none
of its search or execution options.

| Option | Default | Meaning |
|:--|:--|:--|
| `--model-path <dir>` | required | Model directory; must contain `config.json`. |
| `--framework <name>` | required | `sglang`, `vllm` or `vllm-aiter`. |
| `--precision <p>` | required | `bf16`, `fp8`, `fp4`, `int8` or `awq`. |
| `--quant-type <q>` | `auto` | As for `run`. |
| `--gpu-type <sku>` | `auto` | As for `run`. |
| `--demand <file>` | `''` | As for `run`; the highest-priority shape source. |
| `--shapes-manifest <file>` | `''` | As for `run`. |
| `--shapes-json <file>` | `''` | As for `run`. |
| `--untuned-csv <file>` | `''` | As for `run`. |
| `--tunableop-input <file>` | `''` | As for `run`. |
| `--kernel-signature-log <file>` | `''` | As for `run`. |

### gemm-tune evidence

Reads serving logs and derives the GEMM shape demand they witness, which `run`
and `plan` then consume as their highest-priority shape source.

| Argument / option | Default | Meaning |
|:--|:--|:--|
| `<logs...>` | required | One or more serving logs to read. |
| `--out <file>` | stdout summary only | Write `demand.json` here. |
| `--verbose` / `-v` | off | Verbose logging. |

## roofline-ceiling

Estimates the **theoretical achievable latency** of one kernel, for each scored
test shape, on the accelerator it runs on. The answer is an optimistic lower
bound under hardware limits and legal algorithm constraints; it does not claim
an implementation reaching it exists.

The command is self-contained: it collects its own evidence, runs its own
analyst session, publishes `performance_ceiling.json` plus
`performance_ceiling_analysis.md`, and shares no state with a campaign. No
campaign reads what it publishes. Run it when you want the ceiling before
committing a campaign's budget to the kernel.

A campaign that wants a ceiling estimates its own, with `forge-loop
--roofline-ceiling on`. That path is the cheaper one: the ceiling is derived
once the baseline has already fixed the scored case set and measured each case
over repeated runs, so it needs no discovery pass of its own and its sanity
reference is the campaign's median rather than a single run.

This command reports no attainment ratio. It has no baseline to divide by
except a single run of the benchmark; a campaign measures its own attainment
against its own per-case medians, taken over repeated runs of the kernel it is
currently keeping. See `--roofline-target` under `forge-loop`.

The estimate is an agent's, composition included, because no table covers MoE
routing, paged attention, fusion legality or occupancy derating for an arbitrary
operator, and a fixed composition rule makes the analyst distort its model to
fit the rule. The hardware is not the agent's: it is handed measured peaks,
bandwidths and a launch cost, and told to use those and nothing it recalls. Each
published report carries the analyst's own derivation — formulas, figures used
and assumptions — because nothing recomputes the latencies and that document is
the only record of how they were reached.

The hardware figures are the analyst's too. It measures them on the box during
its session — `rocprof-compute --roof-only` for the peaks and bandwidths, a
graph-timed probe for the dispatch floor — and records what it established, and
how, in the derivation. Nothing is cached and no measured figure is written to
a shipped artifact: the roofs belong to the run that measured them.

Recalled peaks are the fallback when no profiler can be reached, and the
derivation has to say so. No card sustains its datasheet, and the shortfall is
not a fixed discount: it differs from one instruction path to the next, so
cases of different dtypes stop being comparable and attainment reads too low to
reach a target. That is the safe direction to fail in — a campaign runs longer
than it needed to rather than stopping with the work half done.

The analyst session therefore runs with a shell and may install what it needs.
Every file in the workspace is snapshotted before it starts and restored after,
so the kernel under optimization is out of reach.

The scored case set comes from the driver's own `case_ms:` lines, not from a
configuration file, and cases the driver tags `unscored` get no ceiling.

| Option | Default | Meaning |
|:--|:--|:--|
| `--workspace <dir>` | required | Kernel workspace to analyse. |
| `--kernel <file>` | config.yaml `source_file_path` | Source file the analyst models; repeatable. |
| `--driver <file>` | `''` | Measurement driver, passed to the analyst as context. |
| `--config <file>` | `<W>/config.yaml` | Task configuration supplying `performance_command` and `source_file_path`. |
| `--performance-command <cmd>` | config.yaml `performance_command` | Shell command that runs the timed benchmark. |
| `--output-dir <dir>` | `<W>/forge_experiments/roofline_ceiling` | Where the report, the document and the evidence are published. |
| `--arch <gfx>` | detected | Target architecture, e.g. `gfx950`. Detected via `rocminfo` when omitted; a marketing name such as `MI355X` is accepted. |
| `--agent-provider <name>` | auto-selected | Agent provider for the analyst session. |
| `--agent-model <name>` | provider default | Analyst model. |
| `--agent-timeout-sec <s>` | `3600` | Wall-clock budget for the analyst session. |
| `--run-timeout-sec <s>` | `1800` | Wall-clock budget for each measurement subprocess. |

Two files are published. `performance_ceiling.json` is the answer and nothing
else: `cases`, mapping each scored case id to its ideal latency in
milliseconds, and `mean_ideal_ms`, the equal-weight mean across them — equal
weight because that is how the campaign scores the suite.

`performance_ceiling_analysis.md` beside it carries the derivation: the roofs
the analyst measured and how, the per-case arithmetic, what bounds each shape,
and every assumption. Nothing recomputes the latencies and nothing checks their
arithmetic, so that document is the whole of what a reader has when deciding
whether to believe them.

Both files are written by the analyst itself. The framework reads the JSON back
and checks one thing: whether it can be read as an answer — a non-empty `cases`
object of finite positive latencies. A file that cannot is handed back once
with the reason. A file that can is taken as given.

The session therefore runs with a shell and a writable sandbox, because
reaching a profiler on an arbitrary image means installing packages and that is
open-ended work code cannot enumerate. Two things bound it: a pre-tool hook
refuses edits outside the output and evidence directories, and the workspace
guard snapshots every workspace file before the session and restores it after,
so the kernel under optimization comes out as it went in.

The result dict (`ideal_ms` per case, `mean_ideal_ms`, `report_path`) is
printed to stdout wrapped in `__FORGE_ROOFLINE_CEILING_RESULT__` sentinels.
