"""How much of the estimated ceiling a kernel has actually reached.

Attainment is ``t_ideal / t_current`` per case: the fraction of the estimated
best achievable latency the current kernel is delivering. One at the ceiling,
one half at twice the ceiling's latency.

It is derived here rather than stored on the report because the divisor is not
the ceiling module's to choose. The ceiling run has at most one timing of the
kernel it was handed, and the kernel it was handed is not the one a campaign
ends with: attainment has to follow the incumbent, measured over repeated runs.
The campaign's own per-case medians are the only divisor that makes the ratio
mean anything, so attainment is computed where those live and cached nowhere.

Aggregation is the equal-weight mean over cases, matching
``calculate_mean_case_speedup`` -- the objective a KEEP is already judged by. A
stopping rule and a KEEP rule that optimize different aggregates would pull the
campaign in two directions.

Coverage is the load-bearing part. A case whose ceiling cannot be scored is
excluded from the mean, which means the mean no longer describes the objective:
drop the three hard shapes and the four easy ones average well above target.
:meth:`Attainment.covers` exists so a caller that acts on the number can insist
on the whole case set first, the same way ``CaseCoverageError`` guards scoring a
candidate against the baseline.
