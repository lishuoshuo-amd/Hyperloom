"""Which machine this is, so the analyst measures and names the right one.

Only identity lives here. The roofs themselves are measured by the analyst
during its session and never stored: a committed figure ages out of date
silently, and a measured one is not ours to publish.

Identity is what the analyst is told about the card it is estimating for, so a
session that cannot reach a profiler still names the right machine when it
falls back. It checks nothing: no code compares a reported roof against this
card's published peaks, so a misread profiler column reaches the ceiling unless
a reader of the derivation catches it.

Partition mode is part of the identity rather than metadata on it: splitting an
MI355X into CPX changes the bandwidth one slice can reach, so the same card
under SPX is a different machine and its roofs are different numbers.
