"""The analyst session: it measures the box, derives the ceiling, writes both files.

Everything about the estimate is the analyst's -- the roofs, the minimum legal
work, how that work composes, and the two files it lands in. This module opens
the session, bounds where it may write, and reads the answer back.

The only thing checked is whether ``performance_ceiling.json`` can be read as
an answer at all. A file that cannot is handed back with the reason; a file
that can is taken as given. Nothing re-derives a latency, because a framework
that could would be asserting a work model this design already found too narrow
for real operators.

The session needs a shell -- reaching a profiler on an arbitrary image means
installing packages, and that is open-ended work code cannot enumerate -- so
the workspace has to be defended rather than trusted. It is defended twice.

The workspace guard is the real line: granting shell makes it active instead of
skipped, and ``protected_globs=["*"]`` puts every file under it, so the kernel
comes out of the session exactly as it went in. That strictness has a
consequence worth stating, because it is not obvious and it cost a run to find:
the guard counts *new* files in the workspace as violations too, and rolls the
tree back when it finds any. An analyst writing its answer under the workspace
would therefore have its answer deleted on the way out.

So the analyst writes into a scratch directory outside the workspace, and this
module moves the two deliverables into place afterwards. The hook is the second
line, refusing the editing tools anywhere but that scratch directory, which
turns a wrong path into a message the analyst can act on rather than a rollback
it never sees.
