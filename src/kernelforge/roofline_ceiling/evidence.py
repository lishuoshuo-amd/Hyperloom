"""Deterministic inputs to the ceiling: the case set, the machine's identity, the trace.

No agent here. This settles what must not vary between runs -- which shapes are
scored, what the kernel really dispatches, and which machine this is -- before
the analyst session starts.

The roofs are deliberately *not* settled here. The analyst measures them itself
during its session, because getting a profiler onto an arbitrary image is
open-ended work that code cannot enumerate, and because no measured figure is
then written to any artifact this module owns. Nothing checks the figures it
reports: the contract reads the shape of the report and no more, so the
derivation it publishes is the only place a misread profiler column is caught.

Whether the roofs were measured or recalled is recorded by the analyst in the
derivation it publishes. The gap between the two is not a fixed discount -- it
varies per instruction path -- so a reader who needs to know reads the
document rather than a field.
