"""Every agent session takes its model and effort from the runtime.

Two properties are asserted here, and they are the same property seen from two
sides: what a session runs as is a deployment decision, not a call-site one.

* No call site writes ``reasoning_effort=`` on a run spec. One that did would
  be ignored under :meth:`AgentRunSpec.resolved` -- the runtime outranks it --
  and a dead argument that reads like a live one is worse than none, because
  the next reader believes it.
* The context window is applied where the runtime is built and nowhere else,
  and it is empty unless a deployment names one.
* The one exception is ``max_reasoning_effort``, which can only lower and is
  spent on a single structurally-non-reasoning call; a second one has to be
  argued for by editing the test that names it.
